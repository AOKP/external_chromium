This directory contains files that we've used to create images. If you
need to change images, edit these files instead of the gif/png files
that are derived from them.

overview-arch.graffle
-----
An OmniGraffle file used to create the arch-* figures in overview.html.
Turn different layers on and off to get the figures. E.g., arch-1.gif
uses 2 layers: browser and 1ts. There's probably a better way, but to
create the images I set the layers' visibility appropriately and took
snapshots, which I then cropped.

overview-arch.svg
-----
SVG version of overview-arch.graffle, since OmniGraffle is Mac-only. Hope
it works.

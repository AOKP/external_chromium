Until the
<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/">Chrome Web Store</a>
is available to the public,
you can host your extension
using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">Extensions Gallery</a>.
Once the store is public,
the gallery's contents will be merged into the store.
Another option
is hosting your extension on other servers.
</p>

<p>
This page gives tips for using the gallery,
as well as details on how to host extensions on your own server.
</p>

<h2 id="gallery">Publishing to the Extensions Gallery</h2>

<p>
To publish extensions,
you first need to pay a one-time
<a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/08/security-improvements-and-registration.html">$5 developer registration fee</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If you used the Chrome Developer Dashboard before
the first developer preview release of the Chrome Web Store &mdash;
to publish an extension, for example &mdash;
you don't need to pay the fee.
</p>

<p>
Publishing to the gallery is easy,
but your extension might be more popular
if you take a little time to prepare:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Visit the
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">gallery</a>
    and look at similar extensions' pages.
    Your extension's page should look at least as good as theirs. </li>
  <li> Consider creating a support site for your extension,
    maybe a <a href="http://groups.google.com">Google Group</a>.
    If your extension's page has a link to your support site,
    people will be less likely to
    complain in the user comments. </li>
  <li> Consider creating a custom Gmail account
    for this extension or for all of your extensions.
    Only one account can upload, publish, and update your extension. </li>
  <li> Create some great text (titles and descriptions)
    and images (maybe even video) for your extension.
    See the
    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=113909">gallery help</a>
    for details on screenshot and text requirements. </li>
</ul>

<p>
To upload your extension,
just zip up your extension's directory,
go to the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/developer/dashboard">Developer Dashboard</a>,
and add your extension.
This creates a page for your extension,
viewable only by you.
Now you can edit your extension's page &mdash;
uploading images, specifying text, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Once you verify that your extension's page looks good
and all links are valid,
publish your extension.
</p>

<p>
When you want to update your extension,
use the dashboard to upload and publish the new version.
Your users will automatically get the new version
over the next few hours.
</p>


<h2 id="server">Hosting on your own server</h2>

<p>
By convention, extensions are served &mdash;
whether by the gallery or by a custom server &mdash;
as <code>.crx</code> files.
When you upload an extension to the gallery,
the gallery creates the <code>.crx</code> file for you.
If you aren't using the gallery,
you need to create the <code>.crx</code> file yourself,
as described in <a href="packaging.html">Packaging</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If you do your own hosting,
don't forget to set up
<a href="autoupdate.html">autoupdate</a>,
so you can be sure that
your extension's users have the latest version.
</p>

<p>
A server that hosts extensions
must use appropriate HTTP headers,
so that users can install your extension
by clicking a link to it.
</p>

<p>
Google Chrome considers a file to be an extension
if <b>either</b> of the following is true:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The file has the content type
    <code>application/x-chrome-extension</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    The file suffix is <code>.crx</code>
    and <b>both</b> of the following are true:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The file <b>is not</b> served with
        the HTTP header <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        The file <b>is</b> served
        with one of the following content types:
        <ul>
          <li> empty string </li>
          <li> "text/plain" </li>
          <li> "application/octet-stream" </li>
          <li> "unknown/unknown" </li>
          <li> "application/unknown" </li>
          <li> "*/*" </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The most common reason for failing to recognize an extension
is that the server sends the header
<code>X-Content-Type-Options: no sniff</code>.
The second most common reason
is that the server sends an unknown content type &mdash;
one that isn't in the previous list.
To fix an HTTP header issue,
either change the configuration of the server
or try hosting the extension at another server.

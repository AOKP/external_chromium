# A list of txt's to build
# Note: 
#
#   If you are thinking of modifying this file, READ THIS. 
#
# Instead of changing this file [unless you want to check it back in],
# you should consider creating a 'reslocal.mk' file in this same directory.
# Then, you can have your local changes remain even if you upgrade or
# reconfigure ICU.
#
# Example 'reslocal.mk' files:
#
#  * To add an additional locale to the list: 
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  GENRB_SOURCE_LOCAL =   myLocale.txt ...
#
#  * To REPLACE the default list and only build with a few
#     locale:
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  GENRB_SOURCE = ar.txt ar_AE.txt en.txt de.txt zh.txt
#
#
# Generated by LDML2ICUConverter, from LDML source files. 
#
# The downstream packager may not need this file at all if their package is not constrained by
# the size (and/or their target OS already has ICU with the full locale data.)
#
# Listed below are locale data files necessary for 40 + 1 + 8 languages Chrome is localized to.
#
# In addition to them, 35 "abridged" locale data files are listed. Chrome is not localized to them, but
# uses a few categories of data in those locales for IDN handling and language name listing (in the UI).
#

# Aliases which do not have a corresponding xx.xml file (see icu-config.xml & build.xml)

Description:
This is Expat XML parser - very lightweight C library for
parsing XML, typically linked as a static lib.
File tree is expanded from the win32-specific download of Expat from:
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/expat/expat-win32bin-2.0.1.exe
Some directories are not checked in (bin, examples, tests)

Local Modifications:
The only modifications from the downloaded version is a patch to an
internally discovered bug with the handling of utf-8 characters,
that leads to a crash (CL 6144603 etc.), and a change has been made to
winconfig.h to prevent a compiler warning when compiling with
WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN defined.

The typical usage of the library is to compile it in or compile it
into a static lib and link in.

The files you need to compile are:
lib\xmlparse.c
lib\xmltok.c
lib\xmlrole.c

Following compile-time #define variables can be used:
XML_DTD     - if you need to parse DTDs and validate
XML_UNICODE - if defined, all strings are 16-bit unicode, if not then UTF8.
              defines XML_Char appropriately
XML_UNICODE_WCHAR_T - if XML_UNICODE is defined, controls whether XML_Char
                      is wchar_t or unsigned short
COMPILED_FROM_DSP - if defined, automatically defines XML_UNICODE
                    and includes windows headers
XML_STATIC - should be defined to produce statically-linked DLL
XML_MIN_SIZE - if defined, produces smaller but slower code
